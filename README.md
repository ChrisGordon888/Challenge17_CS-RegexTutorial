# Regex Tutorial: Email Validation

This repository contains a GIST that explains the functionality of a regular expression (regex) pattern used for validating email addresses. The tutorial breaks down each component of the regex and provides a detailed explanation of its purpose, helping readers understand how the regex functions and how to use it effectively.

## Challenge Description

As part of the Computer Science Challenge Assignment Challenge, developers are not only required to write code but also to write about code. The challenge prompts participants to create a tutorial that explains how a specific regular expression (regex) functions by dissecting each part of the expression and describing its purpose.

## Regex Summary

The regex pattern covered in this tutorial is designed to validate email addresses. It ensures that an email address follows the standard format and includes a valid username, domain, and top-level domain (TLD). Here is the regex pattern:

Regex:
^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$
