# Title (Regular Expression Tutorial: Email Validation)

This tutorial breaks down the structure and purpose of a regular expression (regex), which is used to validate email addresses. The purpose here is to deepen the understanding of how this specific regex operates, and how to effectively use the regex in one's own projects.

## Summary

In this tutorial, I examine a regex pattern designed to validate email addresses. This pattern ensures that the provided email conforms to standard formatting, which includes a valid username, domain, and top-level domain (TLD). Below is the regex pattern:

^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$

## Regex Components

### Anchors
Anchors, represented by ^ and $, are used to mark the start and end of a line or string. In our email regex, ^ ensures that the pattern matches from the beginning of the string, while $ ensures it matches to the end. In essence, they declare that the entire string should represent a complete email address, not just a portion.

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are symbols that dictate the quantity of characters that should be matched. The + symbol in our regex acts as a quantifier, expressing that one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern are expected. In the context of our email regex, it allows multiple characters to form both the username and domain name, hence accommodating varying lengths of email addresses.


### OR Operator
The | symbol, known as the OR operator, isn't utilized in our regex. However, it generally serves to provide alternative options for matching in regex patterns.

### Character Classes
Character classes are denoted inside square brackets [] and are used to match a specific set of characters. For instance, [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-] in our regex matches any alphanumeric character, period, underscore, percent sign, plus sign, or hyphen. This range allows for a versatile username structure in the email address.

### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of the regex pattern. However, our email regex doesn't utilize any flags.

### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses () are generally used for grouping and capturing in regex patterns. This isn't explicitly used in our email regex.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions are similar to character classes, they define a set of characters to match. Our regex employs [a-zA-Z0-9.-] to allow any alphanumeric character, period, or hyphen in the domain, thus providing flexibility for domain naming conventions.


### Greedy and Lazy Match
Quantifiers in regex can be "greedy" or "lazy". Greedy quantifiers, such as + and {2,} in our regex, aim to match as many characters as possible. The {2,} quantifier specifically ensures that the top-level domain (TLD) - the part of the email address after the final dot - is at least two characters long, conforming to real-world TLDs like .com, .org, .io, etc.

### Boundaries
Boundaries refer to positions in the string with specific characteristics. These are not utilized in our email regex.

### Back-references
Back-references allow for referencing previously matched groups. However, this feature isn't used in our email regex.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions check for a pattern without consuming characters. These aren't used in our email regex.
