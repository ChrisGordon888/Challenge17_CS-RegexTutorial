# Title (Regular Expression Tutorial: Email Validation)

This tutorial breaks down the structure and purpose of a specific regular expression (regex), which is used to validate email addresses. The aim is to deepen the reader's understanding of how this regex operates and how to effectively use it in their own projects.

## Summary

In this tutorial, we dissect a regex pattern designed to validate email addresses. This pattern ensures that the provided email conforms to standard formatting, which includes a valid username, domain, and top-level domain (TLD). Below is the regex pattern:

^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$

## Regex Components

### Anchors
The ^ and $ symbols, known as anchors, denote the start and end of a line or string, respectively. Within our email regex, they ensure that the pattern matches the entire string from the beginning to the end.

### Quantifiers
The + symbol acts as a quantifier, matching one or more occurrences of the preceding pattern. In our email regex, it allows multiple characters in the username and domain name.

### OR Operator
The | symbol, known as the OR operator, isn't utilized in our regex. However, it generally serves to provide alternative options for matching in regex patterns.

### Character Classes
Character classes are designed to match a specific set of characters. In our regex, we use [a-zA-Z0-9._%+-] to match any alphanumeric character, period, underscore, percent sign, plus sign, or hyphen in the username.

### Flags
Flags modify the behavior of the regex pattern. However, our email regex doesn't utilize any flags.

### Grouping and Capturing
Parentheses () are generally used for grouping and capturing in regex patterns. This isn't explicitly used in our email regex.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions define a set of characters to match. In our regex, we use [a-zA-Z0-9.-] to match any alphanumeric character, period, or hyphen in the domain.

### Greedy and Lazy Match
The concepts of greediness and laziness dictate the behavior of quantifiers. In our regex, the quantifiers + and {2,} are greedy, which means they aim to match as many characters as possible.

### Boundaries
Boundaries refer to positions in the string with specific characteristics. These are not utilized in our email regex.

### Back-references
Back-references allow for referencing previously matched groups. However, this feature isn't used in our email regex.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
Look-ahead and look-behind assertions check for a pattern without consuming characters. These aren't used in our email regex.
